TriangleTracker
---

This is the website for a triangle tracker created by Zenas Muli as requested by
Moringa School.
---

By *Zenas Muli*
---

This website serves as an application that defines and helps to identify whether
 certain values are triangles and what type of a triangle they are. This is done
 through JavaScript logic.
 
---

It was created on HTML and CSS and JavaScript to
give logic to the calculations to be done and beauty to the page itself.

---
There are no known bugs. However, if you stumble upon one please send a
description of the bug to the hosts's email zenas2294@gmail.com.
