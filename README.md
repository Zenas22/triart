This website serves as an application that defines and helps to identify whether
 certain values are triangles and what type of a triangle they are. This is done
 through JavaScript logic.
===

It was created on HTML and CSS and JavaScript to
give logic to the calculations to be done and beauty to the page itself.

There are no known bugs. However, if you stumble upon one please send a
description of the bug to the hosts' email zenas2294@gmail.com.
